- Needs implementation for:
  - User authentication
  - Profile management
  - Wallet connections

#### 6. **Analytics Service** (Port 3014)
- Structure created
- Needs ClickHouse integration
- Event tracking implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Services

7. **Social Hub Service** (Port 3017)
8. **Telegram Bot Service** (Port 3015)
9. **Twitter Bot Service** (Port 3016)
10. **Scheduler Service** (Port 3018)
11. **Admin Dashboard** (Port 3019)
12. **Gaming Hub** (Port 3001)

## How to Run the Microservices

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Run from project root
./scripts/install-microservices.sh
```

### 2. Start Infrastructure
```bash
# Start PostgreSQL, Redis, RabbitMQ, ClickHouse
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d postgres redis rabbitmq clickhouse
```

### 3. Start Microservices
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d

# Or start specific services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.microservices.yml up -d api-gateway payment-service rewards-service game-engine
```

### 4. Check Service Health
```bash
# API Gateway health
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Individual services (through gateway)
curl http://localhost:3000/api/payments/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/rewards/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/game/health
```

## Testing the Migration

### Test Payment Flow
```bash
# Generate payment address
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/payments/buy-life \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "test-wallet-address", "gameId": "tetris"}'
```

### Test Daily Claim
```bash
# Claim daily lives
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/rewards/claim-daily \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"wallet": "test-wallet-address", "deviceId": "test-device", "ip": "127.0.0.1"}'
```

### Test Game Validation
```bash
# Submit game score
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/game/end-round \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "wallet": "test-wallet-address",
    "gameId": "tetris",
    "seed": "test-seed",
    "moves": [{"type": "move", "timestamp": 1000, "direction": "left"}]
  }'
```

## Architecture Benefits

1. **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently
2. **Fault Isolation**: Service failures don't bring down the entire system
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Services can use different tech stacks
4. **Development Speed**: Teams can work on services independently
5. **Deployment Flexibility**: Services can be deployed separately

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining service implementations
2. Add comprehensive error handling and retry logic
3. Implement service discovery and load balancing
4. Add monitoring and logging (ELK stack)
5. Set up CI/CD pipelines for each service
6. Implement API versioning
7. Add integration tests
8. Set up Kubernetes deployment configurations
