2. **Technology Freedom**: Each team can choose the best tools for their specific needs
3. **Scalability**: Scale only what needs scaling
4. **Clear Ownership**: Each repository has clear boundaries and responsibilities
5. **Easy Onboarding**: New developers can focus on just the repository they need
6. **Version Management**: Each component can evolve at its own pace
7. **Cost Optimization**: Different hosting solutions for different needs
8. **Security Isolation**: Compromised service doesn't affect others

## 🔧 Development Workflow

### For Game Developers:
1. Install SDK: `npm install @gamefi/sdk`
2. Integrate into their game
3. Never need to touch other repositories

### For Platform Developers:
1. Clone specific repository they're working on
2. Run locally with mock services
3. Deploy independently

### For Full Platform Development:
1. Use docker-compose to run all services
2. Or run specific services as needed
3. Each service has its own development environment

This structure provides maximum flexibility while maintaining clean boundaries between different aspects of the platform!
