## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Bot not responding**
   - Check `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is correct
   - Verify bot has permission to send messages
   - Check health endpoint: `/health/detailed`

2. **Database connection errors**
   - Verify PostgreSQL is running
   - Check database credentials
   - Ensure database schema is initialized

3. **Webhooks failing**
   - Check webhook URLs are accessible
   - Verify webhook secret matches
   - Monitor `/api/webhooks/stats` for errors

4. **Games not starting**
   - Check minimum player requirements
   - Verify players have joined successfully
   - Check game status with `/status` command

### Logs
```bash
# View service logs
